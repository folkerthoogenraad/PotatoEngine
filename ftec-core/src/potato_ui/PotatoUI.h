/*
Potato UI is a user interface system for realtime software. 
Every panel gets an update call every frame and, if needed, every panel
can redraw every frame.

This is not yet implemented, but will be implemented using OpenGL on the
PotatoEngine bases. The PotatoEngine will be fully compatible with the
PotatoUI (obviously).
